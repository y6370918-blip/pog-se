<h1>Paths of Glory: Supply Warnings</h1>

<hr>
<p>
Except by prior mutual agreement by <i>both</i> players, supply warnings should <i>always</i> be used 
in tournament games, as a matter of courtesy, sportsmanship, and respect for the community. They are
strongly recommended for regular games as well. Nobody likes to lose a multi-hour game 
simply because of a clerical error or because they didn’t see the threat develop, and 
asynchronous play makes it harder for players to maintain perfect context at every action round. 
The line between expected skill/vigilance and courtesy can be a subjective one, but Supply
Warnings have been part of the online PoG community for many years, and their use has been made
compulsory in most major tournaments (e.g. WBC, BPA, Ladder). 

<p>
What exactly are “supply warnings”?

<p>
Supply warnings are generally intended to allow a player to retract, prevent,
or otherwise adjust their move so that their units won’t be put out of supply.
Warnings should either be indicated using the "Flag Supply Warnings" button (click
on the "barrel" icon); alternatively mentioning in chat also works. Warnings should 
be specific as to which units are threatened. Failure to issue a warning precludes 
a player taking advantage of the Out of Supply (OOS) situation until the opponent has a chance to 
remediate it. Some specific examples of when they should (and shouldn’t) be issued:

<ul>
<li>
The AP player makes a move that threatens to put several CP units OOS as a
result of a <i>subsequent</i> AP move.  The AP player issues the OOS warning to the CP
player so that he may respond accordingly.

<li>
The AP player makes a move and opens up a hole in his line that exposes his own
units to being put OOS. The CP player alerts him before the CP move and the AP
player can redo his entire move.

<li>
A supply warning DOES NOT need to be made if it requires a combat and advance
after combat to generate the OOS situation. Some players, by agreement or otherwise,
do also choose to alert "combat required" OOS situations, but this is optional.

<li>
A player may ignore an OOS warning. His opponent need not remind him of the
same threat again and may freely put the threatened units OOS if the player
chose to not respond to the threat.

<li>
A player may NOT issue an OOS warning "on himself" with the intent to redo a
prior turn. Example: The AP moves and creates an OOS threat on his own units
and neither player notices it. The CP player moves but does not put the AP
units OOS. The AP player, in this situation, may not use the excuse of a
‘missed supply warning’ to redo his original move. 

<li>
A player noticing a hole in his own lines should correct it or acknowledge that
he has seen a threat and is choosing to ignore it: it is considered unethical to 
exploit supply warning rules to try to gain an advantage by pretending one didn't see it.

<li>
After a combat, an attacker SHOULD issue a supply warning if a defender
retreats in a manner that a combat advance will put defending units OOS. The
defender can freely adjust his retreat at this time.

<li>
When a supply warning is issued and a player needs to retract his previous move in order
to avoid being put OOS, a rollback should be offered. In an ideal world, the opposing player 
would check the active player's movements before any combat and trench dice are rolled, but 
practically speaking it will sometimes transpire that combat has started and opposing player 
sees a supply warning. Nonetheless the supply warning should be issued and a rollback offered,
or else the opposing player should not exploit the OOS situation on his next round.

<li>
It should be noted that there are numerous instances where a supply threat can
be created, and executed upon (units put out of OOS), before the threatened
player can respond. Note that if the OOS threat is NOT executed upon, the
supply warning should still then be issued. Examples of where an OOS
move can be executed without the ‘threatened’  being able to respond include:

<ul>

<li>
Player A conducts an attack that results in Player B retreating a defending
unit to a place from which it can, in its next round, put one
or more Player A units OOS. In this case Player B is allowed to exploit Player A's
mistake (of not predicting the possible consequences of his own attack) and may
put Player A's units OOS. If Player B chooses not to do so in his next action round,
he should at this point issue a supply warning.

<li>
Player A conducts an attack that results in attacker losses that open a hole in
Player A’s own lines. On his next round, Player B may then take
advantage of this hole in the line to put Player A units OOS. If for whatever
reason he chooses not to do so, he should at that point issue a supply warning.

</ul>

</ul>
