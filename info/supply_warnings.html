<h1>Paths of Glory: Supply Warnings</h1>

<hr>

<p>
What exactly are “supply warnings”?

<p>
Supply warnings are generally intended to allow a player to retract, prevent,
or otherwise adjust their move so that their units won’t be put out of supply.
This is very common in email play as nobody likes to lose a game simply because
their map wasn’t correct or they didn’t see the threat develop. Warnings should
be posted in the ACTS log and should be specific as to which units are
threatened. Failure to issue a warning precludes a player taking advantage of
the OOS situation until the opponent has a chance to remediate it. Some
specific examples of when they should (and shouldn’t) be issued:

<ul>
<li>
The AP player makes a move that threatens to put several CP units OOS as a
result of a SUBSEQUENT AP move.  The AP player issues the OOS warning to the CP
player so that he may respond accordingly.

<li>
The AP player makes a move and opens up a hole in his line that exposes his own
units to being put OOS.  The CP player alerts him before the CP move and the AP
player can redo his entire move.

<li>
A supply warning DOES NOT need to be made if it requires a combat and advance
after combat to generate the OOS situation.

<li>
A player may ignore an OOS warning.  His opponent need not remind him of the
same threat again and may freely put the threatened units OOS if the player
chose to not respond to the threat.

<li>
A player may not issue an OOS warning on himself with the intent to redo a
prior turn. Example:  The AP moves and creates an OOS threat on his own units
and neither player notices it.  The CP player moves but does not put the AP
units OOS.  The AP player, in this situation, may not use the excuse of a
‘missed supply warning’ to redo his original move.

<li>
After a combat, an attacker SHOULD issue a supply warning if a defender
retreats in a manner that a  combat advance will put defending units OOS.  The
defender can freely adjust his retreat at this time.

<li>
It should be noted that there are numerous instances where a supply threat can
be created, and executed upon (units put out of OOS), before the threatened
player can respond.  Note that even if the OOS threat is NOT executed upon, the
supply warning should still be issued.  (11/1/2017)  Examples of where an OOS
move can be executed without the ‘threatened’  being able to respond include:

<ul>

<li>
Player A conducts an attack that results in Player B retreating a defending
unit to a place from which it can, in its next round, put one
or more Player A units OOS.

<li>
Player A conducts an attack that results in attacker losses that open a hole in
Player A’s lines.  On his next round, Player B may then take
advantage of this hole in the line to put Player A units OOS.

</ul>

</ul>
