The game log follows the Paths of Glory Vassal module conventions:

<p>Reduced armies or corps are shown between brackets, e.g (FR 2).

<p>When a corps enters or leaves the reserve box for any reason, the number of corps in the reserve is shown between brackets.

<p>
For example <i>"(FR 5) in Sedan breaks to FRc(6,0)"</i> means that a French
reduced army has been broken down to a corps, taken from the reserve box which
now contains 6 full-strength corps and 0 reduced corps of that nationality.

<p>
Is there a way to warn my opponent that they are in danger of being put out of supply?
<p>
Yes. Click on the oil barrel at the top of the screen, then choose "Flag Supply Warnings".
Select spaces to highlight and then click [Done].
Your opponent will be notified about the spaces you have flagged when it is their turn.

<hr>
<p>
Is there a way to rollback to a previous turn?
<p>
You can rollback by clicking on the oil barrel at the top of the screen, then "Propose Rollback".
It will show you the rollback points available, and also which die rolls would be cancelled by that rollback.
Your opponent will have to accept the rollback for it to be effective.
